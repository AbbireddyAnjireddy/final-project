The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an \\\"EVENT\\\": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A \\\"User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary\\\" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out.

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

The generic subject line \"Never agree to be a loser\" is also typical of phishing emails, designed to provoke a reaction. The domain `iworld.de` seems unrelated to any common or recognized entity.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address looks suspicious and unrelated to the subject line, which is also highly suspicious (\"Befriend Jenna Jameson\").\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (Karmandeep-opengevl@universalnet.psi.br) is suspicious and doesn't appear to be related to CNN.com. The domain 'universalnet.psi.br' has no obvious connection to CNN. The subject line is generic, which is common in phishing attempts.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be an automated message related to a Subversion (svn) commit within the Apache SpamAssassin project.  The sender, although having an unusual email address, is replying to a mailing list associated with SpamAssassin development (\"SpamAssassin Dev <xrh@spamassassin.apache.org>\"). The subject line indicates an svn commit, which is typical for software development projects.  The mention of file paths within the SpamAssassin project (e.g., lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm) further supports its legitimacy.  Phishing emails rarely relate to specific software development tasks and project file structures.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address \"externalsep1@loanofficertool.com\" appears suspicious and unrelated to the subject \"SpecialPricesPharmMoreinfo,\" which is a common tactic in phishing emails to lure recipients.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (dwthaidomainnamesm@thaidomainnames.com) doesn't seem to match the name \"Caroline Aragon\".  This discrepancy is a common phishing tactic to disguise the sender's true identity. Also, the date is from 2008, which is suspicious in modern context unless there is a specific reason for it.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (jhorton@thebakercompanies.com) likely does not match the subject of the email (\"Replica Watches\"). This discrepancy is a strong indicator of phishing, as legitimate businesses usually use email addresses that align with their products or services.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (acidirev_1972@tcwpg.com) is suspicious and doesn't align with CNN.com. Legitimate emails from CNN would likely come from a CNN-owned domain. The random characters and numbers before the @ symbol further suggest a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email originates from the 'issues.apache.org' domain, which is a legitimate domain for Apache projects. The email subject indicates a bug report related to URI processing, which is consistent with the activities of the SpamAssassin project (the recipient).\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (orn|dent_1973@musicaedischi.it) is suspicious. It doesn't align with a legitimate CNN email address, which would likely be from a cnn.com domain. The random characters and unfamiliar domain suggest a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (370jcmiller@flychautauqua.com) is suspicious. It's unlikely a legitimate debt consolidation service would use such an address. The domain \"flychautauqua.com\" seems unrelated to debt consolidation, further suggesting a phishing attempt. The generic subject line \"debt consolidation\" is also a common tactic used in phishing emails.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (rehearsings46@gametea.com) looks suspicious and unrelated to a legitimate sender. The subject line sounds like generic marketing spam, which is a common tactic used in phishing emails.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (`Atchuthan-erbatest@weijgers.nl`) is suspicious and doesn't align with CNN.com. Legitimate news outlets use professional email addresses related to their domain. The random name before the @ symbol and the unfamiliar domain name suggest phishing.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (Scooter-obailat@picklesmaternity.com) has nothing to do with CNN.com and appears to be a random, likely compromised, account. This is a strong indicator of phishing.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (exited@realskate.com) is suspicious and doesn't seem professional or related to a legitimate business. The subject \"Fifth / Sixth month\" is vague and could be an attempt to pique curiosity and lure the recipient into opening the email. The overall combination of these factors suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address \"uqyrmo@sailing.ie\" looks suspicious and doesn't align with a legitimate racing organization. The random characters before \"@sailing.ie\" are a red flag. Also, the subject \"RE: Trial IRC Certificate Application\" is vague and could be an attempt to lure the recipient into opening the email.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (Joep-ntorions@picklesmaternity.com) has nothing to do with CNN, which is a major red flag. The domain \"picklesmaternity.com\" is completely unrelated to CNN. Also, the receiver email (netsearchn@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc) looks like a generic or possibly auto-generated address, which isn't necessarily phishing on its own, but is another factor that increases suspicion given the sender address.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address \"Marci-ntelstok@picklesmaternity.com\" is suspicious. It doesn't seem to relate to CNN, and the domain \"picklesmaternity.com\" is likely unrelated to a news organization. This discrepancy strongly suggests phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a reply to a technical question on the opensuse.org mailing list. The sender's email address, while from a less common domain (hotpop.com), doesn't immediately raise red flags. The subject is relevant to the mailing list and the date is from 2008, suggesting it's not a recent phishing attempt. Without the email body, it's difficult to be 100% certain, but the header alone doesn't indicate phishing.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender address \"cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com\" is highly suspicious. It's an unlikely and generic-looking email address on a free email service (hotpop.com), not associated with any legitimate organization, especially not openSUSE. The recipient address being a general openSUSE mailing list further increases the likelihood of it being spam or phishing. The subject line is less of an indicator but could be used to entice users.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (johvdvu-tqrpvc@aaas-alerts.org) looks suspicious and doesn't align with a legitimate email address structure from a reputable organization like AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science). The random characters before the @ symbol are a common tactic used in phishing emails to avoid spam filters and mask the true sender.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be related to the Perl programming language (as indicated by the sender's domain \"@perl.org\", the subject line referencing a Perl issue, and the presence of \"[perl #46011]\"). While the recipient address looks somewhat unusual, it might be an automated address for a bug tracker or mailing list. Therefore, there's no immediate red flag indicating phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be an automated digest from a mailing list at a legitimate academic institution (waikato.ac.nz). The sender address, while unusual, is likely automatically generated by the list management software. The subject line suggests a digest of posts, which is consistent with mailing list behavior. There's no immediate red flag suggesting phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be an automated message from a source code management system (sourceforge.net) indicating a change/update in a Python project (spambayes). The sender's email address, while unusual, is associated with sourceforge.net, and the recipient is a mailing list at python.org related to that project. The subject line also aligns with typical commit notification emails. There are no immediately obvious red flags that would indicate phishing.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (`cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com`) looks suspicious and unrelated to Aaron Kulkis or any official communication channel associated with the opensuse project. Using a generic, free email service like hotpop.com is uncommon for legitimate project communication, raising a red flag. While the subject seems related to the opensuse mailing list, the sender address is highly indicative of phishing or spam.\n","Phishing|Reason: The subject line \";) Look porno Gallery!!!\" is highly suspicious and indicative of spam or phishing attempts. Legitimate emails rarely, if ever, use such suggestive or explicit language, especially in the subject line.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email header appears normal and doesn't contain any obvious red flags typically associated with phishing emails. The sender's email address, while not a common one, appears to be a legitimate domain. The subject is generic but not alarming. The date is also normal. Without the email body, it is hard to be certain, but based on the headers alone, it does not appear to be phishing.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com) looks suspicious and doesn't align with a legitimate communication from or related to OpenSuse. Free email providers like hotpop.com are often used for phishing attempts. Additionally, the random characters in the sender's email address are a red flag.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (verkoeld1978@stfrancis.k12.mn.us) appears to be a compromised or spoofed account at a school, and the subject line \"Love consultants recommend herbal products\" is a common spam/phishing tactic.\n","Phishing|Reason: Several red flags indicate a phishing attempt: The sender's email address (shadiervh97@gillscruisecentre.com) doesn't seem to match the name \"Maryellen Costello\" and looks suspicious. The subject line \"MBA-Degreees not for sale- get it.\" contains typos and uses a clickbaity tone, typical of spam or phishing emails. The unusual wording of the subject also raises suspicion.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (steins@4000down.com) has nothing to do with CNN.com, which is a strong indicator of phishing.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (xigoing@cityofws.org) appears suspicious. It's an unusual username paired with what looks like a legitimate organization's domain, but legitimate emails typically use a more professional email format (e.g., cara.childs@cityofws.org). The generic subject line \"Man's stuff store\" also raises suspicion. The date is also very old (2008) which makes it unlikely to be a legitimate current communication.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email uses a generic and potentially manipulative subject line (\"Change your weakness to power\"). The sender's email address (Dannie@archie.dk) doesn't seem to relate to any known legitimate service, and the receiver's email address (user2.15@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc) is unusually formatted. The combination of these factors suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's domain \"crypt.org\" seems suspicious and unrelated to a typical service or known contact. The receiver's email address \"oryiufjn@gmail.com\" appears randomly generated, further suggesting this is not a legitimate communication. The vague subject line is also characteristic of phishing attempts to lure the recipient into opening the email.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be from a personal email address and not trying to impersonate a well-known company or service. The subject line is also vague but not alarming, suggesting a genuine inquiry rather than an attempt to trick the receiver. The date also indicates it's a very old email.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address `k|bet2005@0166.co.jp` is suspicious and does not appear to be associated with CNN.com. The domain `0166.co.jp` is unusual for a reputable news organization.\n","Phishing|The subject line is sexually suggestive and unrelated to any legitimate business purpose, and the sender's email address is suspicious. This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients into opening the email or clicking on malicious links.\n","Phishing|The subject line \"Touch her heart with your new babymaker\" is highly suspicious and inappropriate for a professional email. The sender's email address also appears unusual and potentially unrelated to the subject matter.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email header appears to be from a legitimate Apache.org email address related to a bug report. The sender's domain is \"@issues.apache.org,\" and the receiver is \"@spamassassin.apache.org,\" both indicating involvement with the Apache project. The subject line is also consistent with a bug report.\n","Phishing|Reason: The subject line \"Mega-huge dimension for you!\" is highly suspicious and typical of spam or phishing attempts. Legitimate business emails rarely use such sensational and vague language. The combination of a generic email address like \"user2.9@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc\" with a subject that sounds like spam raises red flags.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (dwtiscalim@tiscali.it) looks suspicious and unrelated to the subject or a legitimate organization that would be sending quit-smoking advice. The generic subject line is also a common phishing tactic to lure users.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (Kandace-ukodibeh@victoriaco.com) is unlikely to be the official CNN email address, and appears suspicious. The domain 'victoriaco.com' has no obvious connection to CNN. The fact that the email is trying to mimic a reputable news source (CNN) is another indicator of phishing.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (StaceybearberryRojas@defamer.com) looks suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service. The subject line also appears to be nonsensical and contains unusual words.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender address \"g_nsotzyl@gmx.de\" looks suspicious. It's an unusual GMX (a free email provider) address that doesn't obviously relate to \"Michael Höller.\" The subject line also contains grammatical errors (\"unsure\" instead of \"ensure\") which is common in phishing emails. These inconsistencies raise red flags. While not conclusive on its own, the combination of these factors makes it likely to be a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender address (emailalerts@winnipegfreepress.com) appears to be a legitimate email address from the Winnipeg Free Press. The subject line is also consistent with a news alert. However, without examining the email body, this is only a preliminary assessment. The receiver email address is suspicious as it is obviously a trap/test email account, so somebody at the Winnipeg Free Press may have been testing email sending functionality.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address \"cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com\" looks suspicious and doesn't appear to be related to a legitimate organization or person associated with OpenSuse. The use of a free email service like \"hotpop.com\" is a red flag, especially when contacting an official OpenSuse mailing list.\n","Phishing|The subject \"Answers to erectile dysfunction\" is a common spam and phishing tactic to lure recipients with promises of medication or solutions for a sensitive health issue. The generic sender name \"Nhan\" and the lack of a clear, reputable organization associated with the email further suggest it's likely phishing.\n","Legitimate|The sender address KNTV@nbclocal.com appears to be a legitimate NBC email address. The receiver address trapnbc@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc suggests it's part of a security challenge, implying the email is expected and safe for analysis. The date is also quite old (2008), making it unlikely to be a current phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (ranewc_1999@kamis.pl) is suspicious and unlikely to be the official email address for CNN.com. The domain \"kamis.pl\" is not associated with CNN.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (anovesic@jasonjones.com) doesn't appear to be related to CNN.com, which is the stated source of the \"Daily Top 10\". This discrepancy is a strong indicator of phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender is from a university (@uwaterloo.ca) and the subject refers to a \"Spam Challenge\", suggesting a research or academic purpose. The receiver address, while unusual, could be a mailing list. This aligns with academic communication, making it more likely to be legitimate.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a response to a discussion thread on the opensuse.org mailing list. While the sender's email address (cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com) looks a bit suspicious because it's a free email service and contains random characters, this was much more common in 2008. The receiver is an opensuse mailing list address, and the subject is related to a technical issue, suggesting it's a genuine communication within the openSUSE community. It is unlikely to be phishing, as phishing attacks target individuals with malicious intention. This email appears to be for general discussion.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (cmiqlkx91@hotpop.com) is highly suspicious. It's an unusual, randomly generated string at a free email provider (hotpop.com). This is not typical for legitimate communication related to openSUSE, which would usually come from an openSUSE domain or a known contributor's address.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email originates from the \"issues.apache.org\" domain, which is a legitimate domain used by the Apache Foundation for issue tracking. The subject also appears to be related to a specific bug report within an Apache project (SpamAssassin, based on the receiver address). While sender address spoofing is always possible, the presence of a valid Apache domain makes it far more likely to be a legitimate email, especially given the content is related to bug tracking.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender's email address ends in \"@perl.org,\" which is the legitimate domain for the Perl programming language organization. This suggests it's a legitimate job posting related to Perl.\n","Legitimate|The sender address `xycn-vtnhz@perl.org` ends in `perl.org`, which is the legitimate domain for Perl. Emails about Perl jobs sent to a Perl related email address like `necc@perl.org` would be expected and a normal action. The subject line is also consistent with the purpose of the email list.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a legitimate newsletter from the Organic Consumers Association, sent through a known email marketing service (Democracy in Action). While the subject line might seem sensationalized, it aligns with the OCA's advocacy topics from that era. There's no immediate red flag pointing to phishing. However, without seeing the email body, this is based solely on the header information provided.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender address is from the perl.org domain, which is a legitimate domain for Perl-related communication. The subject line, while possibly unsolicited, is related to Perl jobs, consistent with the domain. The date is also a normal date format. There are no immediately obvious red flags.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (`legrand@wxs.nl`) doesn't seem to match the apparent sender name (\"bradley dept\"). The subject line (\"photo Interesting for 7eac07b0ac7489227e7e5bcf767b2dd3\") is generic and uses a seemingly random string of characters, which is typical of phishing attempts. The overall structure is suspicious.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender address `xycn-vtnhz@perl.org` uses the `perl.org` domain, which is likely the legitimate domain for Perl-related communication. While the subdomain `xycn-vtnhz` looks a bit unusual, it doesn't automatically indicate phishing, especially if it's part of an automated mailing system. The subject line is consistent with job postings related to Perl, which is also expected from `perl.org`. Given that this email dates from 2008, subdomain and email security practices were less stringent then than they are today.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be part of a legitimate mailing list ([spambayes-dev] for a Python project) and the sender's domain (klenner.at) seems plausible. The subject line also seems relevant to a development mailing list. There's no immediately obvious indication of malicious intent from this limited header information.\n","Phishing|Reason: The generic subject line \" All the excitement all the fun and all the money!\" is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients with promises of unrealistic rewards.  The sender's email address also looks suspicious.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address `dwteasm@teas.sk` doesn't seem to relate to the subject of \"money back guarantee\", and the domain `teas.sk` is suspicious. The subject line itself is also a common tactic used in phishing emails to grab attention. The receiver address `user2.8@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc` also seems suspicious.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine question posted to a statistics mailing list (r-help) regarding a statistical modeling technique. The sender's address, while a generic Gmail account, isn't inherently suspicious, and the subject matter is relevant to the mailing list. There are no immediately obvious red flags indicating phishing.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email address \"Earle@cissa-mex.com\" is suspicious and doesn't appear to be a legitimate or trustworthy source. The subject line \"Make your gf happy\" is vague and potentially clickbait, typical of phishing attempts. The receiving email also looks suspicious.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The sender's email address ends in \"@perl.org,\" which is the legitimate domain for the Perl programming language organization. This suggests it's a genuine email related to Perl jobs. While subject and content are needed for a definitive assessment, the sender address itself points towards legitimacy.\n","Phishing|The sender's name \"andrzej janaki\" doesn't match the sender's email address \"linda.groah@kp.org\", which is a red flag. This inconsistency suggests potential spoofing, a common phishing tactic. The generic subject line and unusual receiver address further add to the suspicion.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (arvet1968@shag.dealerspace.com) does not match the purported sender (CNN.com). This discrepancy is a strong indicator of phishing.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (mhunseen@boxingvic.org.au) seems unrelated to the subject line (\"We offer you happiness\"). The subject line is also vague and enticing, a common tactic in phishing emails to lure victims. The date is also quite old, raising further suspicion.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (rezilatn1993@freemail.selfip.org) is suspicious and does not match the purported sender (CNN.com).  The 'freemail.selfip.org' domain is likely a free or disposable email service, which is a common tactic used in phishing attempts.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (sbogeb_1995@zamilsteel.com) does not appear to be related to CNN.com. Legitimate CNN emails would likely come from a CNN domain. The unusual username format (sbogeb_1995) also raises suspicion.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (\"BRalpine@packbell.net\") is suspicious and doesn't align with the subject of online prescriptions. The subject line itself promises prescription-free medication, which is a common tactic used in phishing emails related to pharmaceuticals. The generic subject line \"ID:19346\" also adds to the suspicion.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (RomeoregistrarNoble@geneontology.org) is unlikely to be associated with Bvlgari watches. The subject line (\"Ravishing Bvlgari watches at Replica Classics\") is also a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients with enticing offers. The generic receiver address \"ser@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc\" is another red flag. The email was also sent in 2008, which is also suspicious, though not conclusive.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (ppcwedbyff@gmail.com) is a generic Gmail address and doesn't match any known legitimate source for Python development summaries. The mismatch between the date in the subject (April 1-15, 2007) and the actual date of the email (August 5, 2008) is also suspicious.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (akstcallawasayamnsdgs@allawasaya.com) looks suspicious and unrelated to the name \"Pam Abrams\" and the subject \"Splendid Health Joy\" is generic and potentially a lure.\n","✅ Processed: header_sample_75_without_label.csv → Saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/002 SP 25 Project/04 Manikanth and Anjireddy/001 Submission/All APIs/gemini_llm/output_daata/zeroshot/header_sample_75_without_label_predicted.xlsx\n","Phishing|The email contains generic, attention-grabbing subject lines and promises unrealistic results related to physical attributes, which is a common tactic used in phishing and spam emails. The presence of a suspicious URL (\"whitedone.com\") without context further indicates malicious intent. The unrelated text at the end is also suspicious.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email contains unsolicited and sexually suggestive content with a suspicious link to an unrelated domain (\"brightmade.com\"). This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients to potentially malicious websites.\n","Legitimate|The email body appears to be a genuine CNN daily news update. It includes a list of top videos and stories with corresponding CNN URLs. The email also contains standard CNN copyright information, contact information, and unsubscribe links, which are typical of legitimate email newsletters. While the date is from 2008, the structure and content are consistent with how CNN distributed news updates at that time.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be part of a discussion within the Apache SpamAssassin project about updating the list of valid top-level domains (TLDs). The email includes a technical discussion, code modifications, and links to the Apache Subversion repository, which are all indicative of a legitimate software development project. The sender's email address (@apache.org) also supports this classification.\n","Phishing|The URL provided is suspicious. It uses a URL shortening service (blu.livefilestore.com, seemingly associated with Microsoft OneDrive, but abused here) to hide the actual destination, which is unlikely to be a legitimate website for a company offering \"FastShippingCustomerSupport.\" The random characters in the URL also raise suspicion. Real companies use easily recognizable domains and paths.\n","Phishing|Reason: The text is nonsensical and uses random characters, likely an attempt to bypass spam filters. Legitimate emails wouldn't contain such garbled content.\n","Phishing|The email is advertising counterfeit goods (replica watches), which is a common tactic used by phishing scams. Legitimate businesses typically don't offer or promote illegal activities.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email looks like a genuine CNN daily top 10 email. The links appear to be CNN URLs, the format matches what a CNN email might look like, and it includes unsubscribe links and copyright information. There is nothing overtly suspicious about the email body itself. Also, the date in the body is from 2008, so it is most likely an archived email, not a recent phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email originates from a known and reputable source (apache.org), uses a standard bug tracking system notification format, and doesn't request any sensitive information or contain suspicious links outside the apache.org domain. It's simply an automated notification about a bug update.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a legitimate CNN Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links provided seem to direct to CNN.com and the email includes standard CNN disclaimers, copyright information, and unsubscribe links, which are all indicators of a legitimate email communication from CNN. The date is quite old, but this alone does not make it phishing.\n","Phishing|The email makes unrealistic promises of debt elimination without affecting credit, a common tactic used in debt relief scams. The vague language and emphasis on avoiding traditional methods like bankruptcy or consolidation are red flags. The website URL \"freshplateworks.com\" also appears suspicious and lacks credibility for a legitimate debt relief service.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email is very short and generic, offering Adobe Creative Suite 3 (an old version) with a suspicious link \"oemmerchant.com\". This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure users to malicious websites that might host malware or steal their credentials. The link itself is untrustworthy and likely not an authorized Adobe reseller. A legitimate email from Adobe or an authorized retailer would be more detailed, personalized, and link to the official Adobe website.\n","Legitimate|The email presents itself as a CNN Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links appear to point to CNN domains, and the email includes standard copyright and unsubscribe information consistent with legitimate email newsletters.\n","Legitimate| The email provides links to CNN.com and includes standard information such as CNN's address, copyright notice, privacy guidelines, and unsubscribe links. It also states how the recipient agreed to receive the email. All these factors point to a legitimate email from CNN, especially given the date it references (August 1, 2008). Phishing emails rarely contain this level of legitimate-looking detail.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email makes outlandish claims about increasing size and sexual desire with no scientific basis, uses a suspicious link (\"pacelike.com\"), and lacks credibility or identifiable sender information, all characteristic of spam and potentially malicious phishing attempts.\n","Legitimate|The email chain shows a genuine request for a Trial IRC Certificate and subsequent communication. The replies are consistent with a business interaction regarding an application. The details provided seem plausible for the context of sailing certificates and the presence of a MailWall gateway adds to the legitimacy.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine CNN Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links are to cnn.com, the formatting is consistent with email newsletters, and it includes standard unsubscribe and privacy policy links. The older date helps confirm it is likely an archived or historical email, not a current phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links point to CNN.com domains, the content is consistent with news headlines, and the email includes standard CNN copyright and unsubscribe information. While historical, there's no indication of malicious intent or data harvesting.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be a forwarded discussion from the TuxOnIce-users mailing list. The content discusses technical issues related to the TuxOnIce hibernation software, with multiple participants and quoted replies, which is typical of mailing list conversations. There is no request for personal information or suspicious links, and the email includes standard mailing list footers.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be a forwarded message from a mailing list (Wekalist) related to the Weka machine learning workbench. The content consists of discussions, questions, and answers among list members. There are no obvious indicators of phishing, such as requests for sensitive information, suspicious links, or unusual urgency. The email headers and footers are consistent with a mailing list format.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a digest from ScienceNOW, a legitimate science news source affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The links provided seem to point to sciencemag.org, which is a valid domain for Science magazine and related publications. The email includes options to unsubscribe and contact information, further supporting its legitimacy. There are no obvious red flags like suspicious links or urgent requests for personal information.\n","Legitimate|Reason\n","\n","This email appears to be an automated bug report generated by a perlbug tool. The content is highly technical, including configuration details, code snippets, and environment information related to Perl. It's unlikely a phisher would craft such a detailed and specific email. The email includes information that looks like standard output from a system and specific commands related to a perl installation.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be an automated message from a mailing list server (likely Mailman, given the URLs). It provides standard information about how to subscribe, unsubscribe, contact the list administrator, and includes a table of contents for the day's topics. The email addresses, while obfuscated with random characters before the \"@\" symbol, are consistent with a mailing list system and are from the waikato.ac.nz domain, a legitimate academic institution. There are no obvious red flags like requests for personal information or suspicious links.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be an automated notification from a source code management system (CVS) related to the Spambayes project. The content shows code changes and includes details typical of such notifications. The presence of a mailing list footer further supports its legitimacy. There are no requests for personal information, links to suspicious websites, or other common phishing indicators.\n","Legitimate|The email discusses a technical problem related to disk space and the `du` command, which is consistent with a technical discussion among system administrators or developers. There are no red flags like requests for sensitive information, suspicious links, or urgent deadlines. It appears to be a genuine question about a Linux command.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email body is short, generic, and uses trending topics (Demi Moore) to lure users to a potentially malicious site. The vague call to action \"Go to site!\" and the inclusion of random, short alphanumeric strings as hashtags are typical tactics used in phishing emails to obfuscate the true nature of the link and avoid detection. The lack of personalization and context further suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|Reason: The subject matter (celebrity pornography) and the suspicious URL (somateco.com.br/folderz/ready.php) are both highly indicative of a phishing attempt designed to lure users into clicking a malicious link.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email is a part of a technical discussion about Linux security. It doesn't ask for personal information, request to click any links, or exhibit any other common phishing tactics. It is a genuine discussion.\n","Phishing|Reason: The subject matter (sexual content) and the generic, suspicious-looking URL (\"shinemade.com\") are both red flags indicating a high likelihood of phishing or spam. Legitimate sources rarely use such clickbait titles and unfamiliar domains.\n","Phishing|Reason: Offers diplomas without coursework or exams, guarantees acceptance, and emphasizes confidentiality. This is a common tactic used in diploma mills, which are fraudulent schemes. The poor grammar and formatting also raise red flags.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a legitimate CNN daily top 10 email from 2008. The links provided seem to direct to CNN.com. The email includes CNN's address and copyright information, along with links to CNN's feedback, privacy guidelines, and subscription management pages. The overall format and content align with what one might expect from a legitimate news email. Also, note the date of the email, it is very old.\n","Phishing|The email uses generic language (\"Largest selection of medication products,\" \"best online chemist service\") and contains a suspicious list of seemingly random words at the bottom. This combination is indicative of a phishing attempt trying to lure users into purchasing medication from an illegitimate source or clicking on a malicious link. The random words could be an attempt to bypass spam filters or be indicative of the content being generated using automated and unreliable methods.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email body contains generic, sensational claims about improving one's \"intimate life\" with vague promises and includes a suspicious-looking URL (\"dearbright.com\"). This is a classic tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients into clicking the link, which could lead to malware or a phishing site designed to steal personal information. The unrelated text about bands and the SEC Act suggests the email body was assembled haphazardly, possibly from unrelated sources, further indicating it's likely a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email body appears to be a technical discussion, likely from a mailing list or forum related to the Perl programming language. It discusses a specific behavior in Perl code and proposes a workaround. There are no red flags such as requests for personal information, suspicious links, or urgent calls to action, so it's likely a legitimate technical discussion. The presence of a signature at the end (\"Hugo\") further supports this classification.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be a legitimate inquiry from a bookstore looking for information about a specific book. It provides detailed information about the book, the customer's request, and the bookstore's contact information, including a physical address and phone number. There are no red flags, such as urgent requests for personal information, suspicious links, or grammatical errors, that would suggest a phishing attempt. The email signature also includes the bookstore's name, address, and contact information, which adds to its credibility.\n","Legitimate|The email provides links that appear to direct to CNN.com, which is consistent with a news email. The content is news-related, and it includes standard disclaimers, copyright information, and unsubscribe links that are expected from a legitimate email newsletter. Also, the sender's email address ends in \"cnn.com\", which is a good indicator of legitimacy.\n","Phishing|The email contains a generic, sexually suggestive subject line and a suspicious, shortened URL that likely leads to a malicious website. This is a common tactic used in phishing scams.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email body is extremely short, generic, and uses a vague claim (\"Doctors recommended source\") without specifying any brand or product. The call to action \"Click here!\" is also generic and lacks context, making it suspicious and indicative of a phishing attempt. There is a complete lack of personalization or specific information, which is unusual for legitimate marketing emails.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be an automated notification from the Apache SpamAssassin bug tracking system. The email format is consistent with bug tracking systems, detailing changes to a specific bug report (ID 5780) and the reason for the notification (assignee or watcher). The content references specific bugs, branches, and vote requests, all of which are typical within open-source project workflows. The email originates from what appears to be a bug tracking system's address, and it does not request any sensitive information or prompt suspicious actions.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email uses vague and sensational language (\"increasing formula,\" \"stop dreaming away\") and links to a suspicious-looking URL (\"milddear.com\") without any context of a reputable company or service. The unrelated text at the end also suggests it was pieced together haphazardly, a common tactic in phishing emails.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email promotes a product (anti-smoking patch) and doesn't contain any elements typically associated with phishing attempts such as requests for personal information, urgent calls to action, or suspicious links. It appears to be a marketing email.\n","Legitimate|Reason:This email body appears to be a legitimate email from CNN. It contains news headlines and links to CNN.com. It also includes standard information like copyright notices, contact information, and unsubscribe links, all of which are consistent with legitimate email newsletters. The links, although shortened, appear to direct to CNN domains when inspected.\n","Phishing|The email body contains nonsensical and seemingly random words and phrases. This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to bypass spam filters that look for specific keywords related to scams. The lack of a clear topic or request, combined with the bizarre language, strongly suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be a technical query related to the CRM114 spam filter software. It details a user's experience setting up and troubleshooting the software within the KMail email client. The inclusion of configuration details, command-line examples, and mailing list information related to the CRM114 project indicates a genuine technical issue rather than a phishing attempt. The GMX advertisement at the end seems to be a standard footer for a free email account and doesn't raise suspicion. The inclusion of the SourceForge mailing list footer further supports the email's legitimacy.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This looks like a legitimate email alert from the Winnipeg Free Press. It contains standard elements of a newsletter such as news headlines, links to different sections, copyright information, contact information, a privacy policy, and an unsubscribe link. The date (August 5, 2008) is also consistent with the content. There's no indication of suspicious links or requests for personal information.\n","Legitimate|This email is a discussion about operating system security and philosophies. It does not attempt to trick the recipient into providing personal information, clicking malicious links, or downloading harmful files. It appears to be part of a normal conversation.\n","Phishing|The email body uses sensational and sexually suggestive language (\"schlub,\" \"9 inch tool\") and a suspicious, likely unrelated, website link (\"milddone.com\"). This is a common tactic of phishing emails to lure users into clicking malicious links.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be an automated newsletter from a news source (NBC11.com). It contains news stories, photo galleries, and video links. There are no requests for personal information or suspicious links, and it includes an unsubscribe option, all of which are characteristics of legitimate newsletters. The presence of advertising and a privacy policy further reinforces its legitimacy. The date of 2008 indicates that the email is likely from an archived source.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine CNN Daily Top 10 email from August 1, 2008. It contains news headlines and video links, formatted in a way that is consistent with legitimate email newsletters. The links point to CNN.com domains, and the email includes standard disclaimers and unsubscribe information. There are no obvious signs of phishing, such as requests for personal information or suspicious links.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine CNN.com Daily Top 10 email. It includes news headlines and video links that were relevant on the specified date (August 1, 2008). The links point to CNN domains, and the email includes standard CNN disclaimers, copyright information, and unsubscribe links. While the date is old, it doesn't automatically make it phishing; it could be an archived email.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email announces a legitimate academic event (CEAS Live Spam Challenge). It provides details about the competition, key dates, contact information, and organizers with their affiliations and URLs. The email address information@ceas.cc and the URLs to IBM and the University of Waterloo are consistent with a genuine announcement. Also the ceas.cc domain looks legitimate. The presence of mailing list information at the end further suggests a legitimate automated announcement. There are no obvious red flags like urgent requests for personal information, suspicious links, or grammatical errors.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be a genuine technical discussion between colleagues, likely within an IT or development team. It revolves around a specific problem encountered while using Linux commands and seeks advice on how to achieve the desired result. There are no red flags such as requests for sensitive information, suspicious links, or urgent calls to action.\n","Legitimate|This appears to be a snippet of a genuine email thread discussing software quality and personal experiences. There are no suspicious links, requests for personal information, or other typical phishing indicators. The content seems to be a real conversation between individuals.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email originates from a bug tracking system related to Apache SpamAssassin, a well-known and legitimate open-source project. The email content discusses a specific bug report (5813) and refers to another bug report (5780). It also mentions code reviews and voting, all standard practices in software development. The email address wrzzpv@sidney.com, while unusual, could be a legitimate developer email. The \"You are receiving this mail because...\" section is typical of bug tracking systems. There are no red flags or requests for sensitive information that would indicate phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email contains information about a Perl developer job, including location, description, required skills, desired skills, and URLs for more information and contact. The URLs point to perl.org and mimox.com, which are both likely legitimate websites. The email also provides instructions for subscribing and unsubscribing from the mailing list, which is typical of legitimate email lists. The level of detail is unlike a generic phishing email.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be an automated job posting from a perl.org mailing list. The URLs for both the job and the company (BBC) seem legitimate based on cursory inspection. While old (2008), that doesn't automatically make it phishing. The unsubscribe and subscribe links also point to perl.org.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be a newsletter from the Organic Consumers Association (OCA). It contains relevant information about organic food, health, and environmental issues. It also includes links to their website and ways to subscribe/unsubscribe. While some of the links might lead to donation pages, the content itself isn't inherently malicious or designed to steal personal information. The links provided appear to relate to the content discussed. The provided contact information adds to the legitimacy.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email seems to be an automated job posting from a legitimate source (jobs.perl.org). The email includes details about the job, the company (Epsilon), required skills, and a link to the company's website. The links provided go to perl.org and epsilon.com. There is nothing obviously suspicious about the email content or sender information, so it is most likely a legitimate job posting. The formatting is typical of older automated postings.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email contains a sensationalized subject line (\"Nicole Kidman Shocking photo!!!\") and a generic call to action (\"Go to the site\") with a suspicious and random looking url (\"WQduzYa #CuXrWOz\"). This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure users to malicious websites.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a job posting from a Perl job board. It provides details about the job, company, location, and required skills. The email also includes links to the company's website (dbds.com) and the job posting on the Perl job board (jobs.perl.org). While the email is quite old (2008), the presence of legitimate URLs and the lack of any request for sensitive information suggest that it's a legitimate job posting announcement rather than a phishing attempt. The instructions for subscribing and unsubscribing from the mailing list also support this.\n","Legitimate|The email discusses a technical issue related to spam filtering software and provides context about the problem and the sender. It appears to be a genuine request for help from someone using spambayes, a known spam filtering tool. There are no red flags indicating phishing, such as requests for sensitive information, suspicious links, or urgent calls to action.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email uses overly enthusiastic language (\"dollars pouring in,\" \"smiling\"), promises easy money (\"When YOU WIN, we win!\"), and contains a generic, enticing domain name (\"casinojackpotsdeals.com\"). These are common tactics used in phishing emails to lure users into clicking on malicious links. The lack of specific branding or verifiable company information also raises suspicion.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email promotes a \"guaranteed\" cure for a medical condition (smoking addiction) through an unsolicited advertisement for a herbal product. This is a common tactic used in spam and potentially phishing emails, as it often leads to the sale of ineffective or harmful products. The generic language and lack of specific information further increase suspicion.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be a genuine request for statistical analysis advice on the R-help mailing list. The content discusses statistical methods, experimental design, and the use of R packages, which aligns with the purpose of the mailing list. There are no suspicious links, requests for personal information, or other indicators of phishing. The email signature is also standard for R-help mailing list posts.\n","Phishing|The email uses sensational and sexually suggestive language (\"hottest girls will start shooting rapt glances at your groin!\") and promises unrealistic results (\"bring more love and passion into your life today!\"). The inclusion of a suspicious-looking URL (\"http://dearcan.com/\") further suggests a phishing attempt. The unrelated text about the United Nations Human Rights Council is likely just added noise to try and bypass spam filters. Legitimate emails are not normally incoherent and sexually focused.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email advertises a job opportunity and provides a URL to jobs.perl.org, which is a legitimate website for Perl-related jobs. The email includes details such as job title, company name, location, salary, and a job description. It also gives contact information, including a phone number and email address. There is no indication of urgency or a request for sensitive information that would suggest a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|The email body contains generic and vague language (\"medication safe and effective check out here\") and lacks specific details. It urges the recipient to click a link without providing context or identifying a reputable source. This is typical of phishing attempts trying to lure people to malicious websites.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine CNN.com Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links point to cnn.com, the format is consistent with legitimate email newsletters, and it includes unsubscribe and privacy policy links. The content aligns with news stories from that time period.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email body uses vague and generic language (\"safe and affordable medications,\" \"trusted online health shop\"), contains suspicious keywords (\"entlassene fBftpusers exclamdown\", etc. which seem like random character strings), and lacks specific details or a professional tone. This combination of factors strongly suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine CNN Daily Top 10 email from 2008. The links point to cnn.com domains, and the format is consistent with a legitimate newsletter. The presence of unsubscribe and preference management links further supports its legitimacy. The explicit details about how the user supposedly subscribed and how to manage their preferences or unsubscribe are hallmarks of legitimate emails, not phishing attempts.\n","Legitimate|The email body appears to be a legitimate CNN.com Daily Top 10 email from 2008. It includes news headlines and video links that align with CNN's content, includes valid CNN domains, and provides options to manage subscriptions/preferences. The formatting and included disclaimers are consistent with legitimate email communications.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email promotes the sale of prescription drugs without a prescription, which is illegal and a common tactic used in phishing scams. The promise of no doctor's visits, unlimited quantities, and express delivery coupled with a suspicious-looking domain name (www.outgoeffmedical.com) are all red flags. It is highly likely the site is either selling counterfeit drugs or simply collecting credit card information for fraudulent purposes.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email promotes replica luxury goods (watches, pens, bags), which is a common tactic used in phishing scams. The low prices (\"Cheap luxury gifts\") and the unsolicited advertisement suggest it is likely a scam attempting to sell counterfeit items or steal personal information. The suspicious URL (\"http://minimsoyawl.com/\") further reinforces this classification.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a digest or summary from the Python-Dev mailing list. It contains technical discussion summaries related to Python development, lists of threads, and standard mailing list footers. There are no obvious red flags such as suspicious links, urgent requests for personal information, or mismatched sender addresses.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email body is short, contains a suspicious link to a potentially compromised blog or website (smallworldtho.spaces.live.com/default.aspx), has vague language (\"Extraordinary Medicinal Options\"), and lacks any specific context or personalized information. The disjointed phrase \"Design Patterns, you'll avoid to use them (and when\" is nonsensical and further suggests it's likely spam or a phishing attempt. The sender's signature, \"Victoria K., Boston,\" is very generic. All of these factors raise red flags for phishing.\n","✅ Processed: body_sample_75_without_label.csv → Saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/002 SP 25 Project/04 Manikanth and Anjireddy/001 Submission/All APIs/gemini_llm/output_daata/zeroshot/body_sample_75_without_label_predicted.xlsx\n","Phishing|The email has several red flags: a generic and somewhat motivational/spammy subject line, a body promising unrealistic results (\"Become a lover no woman will be able to resist!\"), a suspicious link (\"whitedone.com\"), and an irrelevant closing paragraph that seems like it was just added to make the email seem less suspicious. The sender's email address also appears unusual and unrelated to the content.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address looks suspicious and unrelated to the subject. The subject is sensationalized (\"Befriend Jenna Jameson\") to lure the recipient. The body contains a generic and suggestive message with a likely malicious link. These are common phishing tactics.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN daily top 10 email. The sender address domain is suspicious but the links point to cnn.com, the email footer has copyright information for CNN and links to CNN privacy policy and feedback pages, as well as unsubscribe instructions.\n","Legitimate|This appears to be a legitimate email thread from 2008 regarding a SpamAssassin update. The sender is discussing a potential issue with the '.so' TLD and its impact on spam filtering, referencing a Wikipedia article. The email also includes a snippet of a previous email thread related to code commits in SpamAssassin, suggesting it is part of a development discussion. The sender's email address, while unusual, doesn't automatically indicate phishing, and the content is technical and relevant to the mailing list it was sent to.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (externalsep1@loanofficertool.com) looks suspicious and doesn't match a legitimate pharmacy or pharmaceutical company. The subject line (\"SpecialPricesPharmMoreinfo\") is generic and attempts to lure the recipient. The body contains a single, suspicious-looking link to a file hosting service (livefilestore.com) which is a red flag, as legitimate businesses typically use their own domains. The lack of any personalized greeting or further information also suggests a phishing attempt.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email has a suspicious sender address (likely spoofed), a generic subject line, and a body containing nonsensical and oddly spaced text. This suggests an attempt to bypass spam filters and potentially lead to a phishing scam.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email promotes \"replica watches\" (likely counterfeit goods). The sender address \"jhorton@thebakercompanies.com\" seems unrelated to watches and could be a compromised account.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate daily top 10 email from CNN.com. The sender address, while not ideal, doesn't immediately scream phishing. The links provided all seem to point to CNN.com, and the content is typical of a news summary email.

The format and content are consistent with automated notifications from a bug tracking system. The email also contains standard disclaimers/explanations about why the user is receiving the email, further supporting its legitimacy.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN Daily Top 10 email. While the sender address is unusual, the body of the email contains content that aligns with CNN news stories of the time. The links provided seem to direct to CNN's website. The presence of copyright information and options to unsubscribe/manage settings further indicate that the email could be legitimate.\n","Phishing|The email exhibits several red flags indicative of phishing or spam:\n","\n","1.  Generic and Vague Subject: The subject line \"debt consolidation\" is generic and could be used to target a wide audience.\n","\n","2.  Unsolicited Offer: The email offers an unsolicited service (debt elimination). Legitimate financial institutions rarely send unsolicited emails of this nature.\n","\n","3.  Unrealistic Claims: The promise of \"legally ELIMINATE your credit card and other unsecured debt\" \"WITHOUT ever making another payment\" and \"WITHOUT it affecting your credit long-term\" is highly improbable and sounds too good to be true. Legitimate debt relief options rarely offer such drastic and risk-free solutions.\n","\n","4.  Sense of Urgency/Exaggeration: The use of words like \"ELIMINATE\" in all caps is designed to create a sense of urgency and exaggerate the benefits.\n","\n","5.  Suspicious Sender Email: The sender's email address (`370jcmiller@flychautauqua.com`) appears random and doesn't clearly relate to a legitimate financial institution. While the domain `flychautauqua.com` might be a real website, it likely has nothing to do with debt relief, which is a common tactic for phishing emails using compromised accounts.\n","\n","6.  Impersonal Greeting/No Personalization: The email lacks a personal greeting and refers to the recipient in a generic way, further suggesting it is a mass email.\n","\n","7.  Vague Disclaimer: The email disclaims bankruptcy, consolidation, and refinancing but doesn't clearly explain the alternative method, which raises suspicion.\n","\n","8.  Website URL: The URL `www.freshplateworks.com` seems unrelated to debt relief, and its legitimacy cannot be confirmed without further investigation, which is risky.\n","\n","These factors strongly suggest the email is a phishing attempt or spam designed to lure recipients into a potentially fraudulent or harmful scheme. It's best to avoid clicking the links or providing any personal information.\n","Phishing|Reason:\n","\n","Several red flags indicate this is likely a phishing email:\n","\n","   Suspicious Sender Address: \"rehearsings46@gametea.com\" is an unusual and unprofessional email address for a legitimate company like Adobe. It doesn't match the expected domain naming convention.\n","   Generic Subject Line: While not definitively malicious, the subject line \"It combines the best of Creative Suite 3 Design Premium, Web Premium, and Production Premium editions\" is fairly vague and could be used in bulk email campaigns.\n","   Unfamiliar Link: \"oemmerchant.com\" is a suspicious domain. Legitimate software vendors usually link to their official website (adobe.com in this case). This domain is likely set up to distribute malware or steal credentials.\n","   Generic Email Body: The email body is very basic and doesn't contain personalized information. It simply lists features of Adobe Creative Suite 3.\n","   Date: The date is from 2008. Adobe Creative Suite 3 is outdated software. A legitimate email from Adobe wouldn't typically promote such old software in this manner.\n","   Lack of Personalization: The email lacks any personal greetings or information specific to the receiver.\n","\n","These elements suggest the email is a phishing attempt to lure the recipient to a malicious website.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN.com Daily Top 10 email. The links within the email direct to CNN.com, and the email includes standard CNN disclaimers and unsubscribe information. The sender's domain, although suspicious at first glance, could be part of a legitimate email marketing setup.

While the sender address \"uqyrmo@sailing.ie\" looks slightly suspicious, the body of the email refers to sailing.ie which is a legitimate sailing website, along with previous correspondence.

The content is related to system administration and power management, and the sender is participating in a discussion about the topic. There's no request for personal information or suspicious links, which are typical indicators of phishing attempts.

The presence of multiple forwarded messages with different senders and subjects further supports the legitimacy of the email.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a legitimate science news alert from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The sender address, while slightly unusual, is on the aaas-alerts.org domain. The content is consistent with a news summary, and the links provided (while truncated) point to sciencemag.org, which is the official website for the journal Science, published by AAAS. Unsubscribe information and contact details are also present, lending further credibility. The copyright notice at the bottom also matches the organization. Finally, the email is from 2008, and sometimes automated emails have strange address formatting.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be an automatically generated bug report from the Perl bug tracking system. The headers include references to \"perl\" and a bug ticket number, and the body contains details about a specific code issue, configuration information, and environment variables, typical of such reports. While the sender domain is perl.org, which is legitimate, always be cautious. However, the content itself doesn't exhibit any phishing characteristics like requests for personal information, suspicious links, or urgent calls to action.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be an automated digest from a mailing list server at the University of Waikato. It contains instructions for subscribing/unsubscribing, contacting the list manager, and a table of contents for the digest.  The email format and content are consistent with typical mailing list digests. There's nothing immediately suspicious about the sender or receiver addresses, as they are likely automatically generated addresses used by the mailing list software.\n","Legitimate|This email appears to be an automated notification from a source code repository (sourceforge.net) related to the Spambayes project, which is associated with Python. The email details a change made to a specific file (storage.py) within the project, including the code differences.

The sender is responding to a query about a Linux command, and the email content does not contain any suspicious links or requests for personal information. The sender's email address from hotpop.com is a bit unusual for a technical discussion, but it's not a strong indicator of phishing by itself, especially given the context and content of the message. The email also references a previous message and follows a conversational tone which is normal for mailing list discussions.\n","Phishing|The subject line \";) Look porno Gallery!!!\" and the body content mentioning \"Demi Moore Full video\" are highly suggestive of spam and phishing attempts to lure users to malicious websites.

The presence of copyright information further supports its legitimacy.\n","Phishing|The email contains generic greetings, claims of a partnership with \"best producers\" without specifying who they are, and offers \"medication products.\" This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients into purchasing potentially harmful or fake medications. Additionally, the random list of words at the bottom is highly suspicious and further indicates a phishing attempt. The sender's email address also appears suspicious.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email has a generic subject line \"Change your weakness to power\" and promises to improve your intimate life immediately, which is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients. The presence of a suspicious link \"http://dearbright.com/\" without any context or explanation raises further concerns, as it could lead to a malicious website designed to steal personal information or install malware. The inclusion of seemingly random sentences at the end further suggests it's a phishing attempt possibly generated or obfuscated by spam techniques.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a technical discussion about a Perl regular expression issue.

The presence of unsubscribe and privacy policy links further suggests it is a legitimate email.\n","Phishing|The email exhibits several red flags indicative of phishing:\n","\n","   Obscure Sender Address: The sender's email address (StaceybearberryRojas@defamer.com) appears nonsensical and doesn't match a typical professional or legitimate organization.\n","   Unusual Subject: The subject line (\"impeccable impedance facet vincent henbane\") is bizarre and doesn't provide any context or purpose.\n","   Gibberish Body: The body of the email consists of random words and phrases that lack coherence and meaning. Legitimate emails typically have a clear message and purpose. The repeated words and nonsensical phrases point towards an attempt to bypass spam filters.\n","   Lack of Personalization: The email doesn't address the recipient by name or provide any specific information that would indicate a genuine communication.\n","   Suspicious Date: While not a definitive indicator, the date is rather old (2008) which raises suspicion, especially if the content is nonsensical.\n","\n","These characteristics strongly suggest that the email is a phishing attempt designed to either deliver malware or trick the recipient into taking a malicious action.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine question from a user of the crm114 software seeking help with their setup. The sender's email address, while not immediately recognizable, isn't inherently suspicious, and the content aligns with the purpose of the crm114-announce mailing list (discussion and announcements related to the crm114 software). There are no red flags like requests for personal information or suspicious links. The GMX signature at the end of the email is a common email provider.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email is from a known news source (Winnipeg Free Press), the sender address matches the domain, and the subject line is consistent with news alerts. The content of the email links to a news story which was a real news event at the time. The email also includes unsubscribe information. All these factors suggest the email is legitimate.\n","Legitimate|The email is a response in an openSUSE mailing list, discussing security concerns and comparing Windows and Linux operating systems. The content is relevant to the mailing list's topic and doesn't contain any suspicious links or requests for sensitive information. While the sender's email address is from \"hotpop.com\", this doesn't automatically indicate phishing, especially in older emails.\n","Phishing|The email has a suspicious subject line (\"Answers to erectile dysfunction\") and includes a link to a website (\"milddone.com\") promising unrealistic results (\"9 inch tool\"). This is a common tactic used in phishing emails to lure recipients into clicking malicious links or providing personal information. The sender's name also appears generic and doesn't inspire trust.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be a genuine newsletter from NBC11.com, containing news stories and links back to their website. There are no obvious phishing attempts, such as requests for personal information or suspicious links. The presence of an unsubscribe link and standard copyright information further supports its legitimacy.\n","Legitimate|The email purports to be a daily top 10 from CNN. The links provided seem to link to CNN properties and the bottom of the email contains the typical unsubscription verbiage as well as a copyright from CNN. The sender email address is suspicious but not enough to discount the entire email as a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate daily top 10 email from CNN. The links provided seem to lead to cnn.com and the email includes standard disclaimers, copyright information, and unsubscribe links, which are expected in legitimate emails from established news organizations.\n","Legitimate|The email announces a legitimate event (CEAS Live Spam Challenge). While the sender's email address `zixgfqei@uwaterloo.ca` is unusual, the body references a known conference (CEAS), provides a link to the CEAS website (ceas.cc), and lists organizers with their affiliations (IBM Research, University of Waterloo) and contact information. The dates mentioned are in the past, which is somewhat unusual, but the email itself does not attempt to solicit personal information, request money, or install software. Also, it appears this was sent to a mailing list specifically for this type of announcement.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be part of a technical discussion on an openSUSE mailing list. The content discusses a specific problem related to disk usage, and the sender provides a technical explanation. There are no links or requests for personal information. The \"hotpop.com\" domain is a free email provider, which might raise a flag in some contexts, but in 2008, it was more common for people to use such services. The rest of the email does not show any other signs of phishing.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email appears to be part of a legitimate discussion thread on the openSUSE mailing list. The content is a reply to previous emails, discussing personal experiences and software versions. There are no red flags like suspicious links, requests for personal information, or urgent calls to action. The sender and receiver domains are consistent with the topic of the email.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email comes from a legitimate Apache.org domain, references a bug report within their issue tracker, and contains information related to the bug's status and potential dependencies on other bugs. The email's content aligns with standard notifications from issue tracking systems like Bugzilla. There are no requests for sensitive information or other red flags associated with phishing attempts.\n","Legitimate|Reason: The email originates from \"@perl.org,\" a legitimate domain for Perl-related activities. It advertises a Perl developer job, a common and expected topic for a Perl-related mailing list. The email also includes standard subscription/unsubscription instructions and links to jobs.perl.org, further reinforcing its legitimacy. Although the email is from 2008, its contents and structure are consistent with a legitimate job posting announcement from a Perl jobs mailing list.\n","Legitimate|The email originates from a perl.org address, is related to job postings as the subject and body suggest, and contains unsubscribe information. The links provided seem to point to legitimate job posting resources, and the body contains details expected in a job posting, like company name, location, pay rate, and required skills. Although the email is from 2008, this isn't necessarily an indicator of phishing. All evidence points to it being a legitimate job posting announcement.\n","Legitimate|The email comes from a known organization (Organic Consumers Association) using a legitimate email address (oca@mail.democracyinaction.org). The content is consistent with the organization's mission and does not contain any obvious phishing attempts like requests for personal information or suspicious links. The unsubscribe links also appear legitimate.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate job posting from the Perl Jobs mailing list. The sender's domain (@perl.org) matches the list's domain. It provides a real job description, company name (Epsilon), location, and contact information links pointing back to the perl.org domain. The unsubscribe information is also consistent with a mailing list. There are no obvious red flags or attempts to solicit personal information beyond what's expected in a job application.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (legrand@wxs.nl) is suspicious and doesn't seem related to any known legitimate service or person. The subject line is generic and uses a hexadecimal string, which is common in phishing emails. The body is short, contains a sensational claim (\"Nicole Kidman Shocking photo!!!\"), and urges the recipient to \"Go to the site\" without providing a clear link or explanation of what the site is. The random strings of characters \"#CuXrWOz\" and \"WQduzYa\" are also suspicious. These are all red flags indicating a phishing attempt.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate job posting from the perl.org domain, which is a well-known and trusted source for Perl-related information. The email provides details about the job, company, and contact information, all of which seem reasonable. The URLs provided also appear consistent with the information given. There's no obvious attempt to trick the reader into revealing sensitive information.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be a genuine query to the spambayes-dev mailing list regarding false positives. The sender seems to be having issues with spambayes incorrectly classifying voicemail notifications as spam and is asking for assistance. The sender's description of their problem and the context of the mailing list suggest a legitimate communication. There are no red flags indicating a phishing attempt, such as requests for sensitive information or suspicious links.\n","Phishing|The email exhibits several characteristics typical of phishing attempts: a vague and overly enthusiastic subject line (\"All the excitement all the fun and all the money!\"), generic greeting and promises of easy money, unsolicited offer, and a suspicious link (casinojackpotsdeals.com). The sender's email address (dtkress@emdas.com) doesn't appear to be related to any reputable casino or gambling organization, further increasing suspicion. The overall tone and content are characteristic of spam and phishing emails designed to lure unsuspecting users.\n","Phishing|The sender's email address (dwteasm@teas.sk) looks suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate anti-smoking product. The subject line (\"Money back guarantee to ensure results!\") is a common tactic used in spam emails. The generic and unsolicited nature of the email body, promoting a product with \"guaranteed results,\" is also indicative of phishing or spam. The formatting is poor, which is another common trait of these types of emails.\n","Legitimate|Reason: This email appears to be a genuine request for statistical advice on the R-help mailing list. The content is related to statistical modeling, and the sender is asking for help with a specific problem. The email is well-structured, and there are no obvious red flags (such as suspicious links or requests for personal information) that would indicate phishing. The sender's email address, while a Gmail address, doesn't automatically indicate phishing, especially when posted on a public forum where anonymity is more common. The inclusion of standard mailing list footer information further supports its legitimacy.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email exhibits several red flags indicative of phishing: a generic subject line (\"Make your gf happy\") designed to lure recipients, a body containing sensational and improbable claims (\"hottest girls will start shooting rapt glances at your groin!\"), a suspicious URL (\"dearcan.com\"), and an irrelevant and abruptly inserted paragraph about the United Nations. These characteristics suggest the email is an attempt to deceive the recipient into clicking a malicious link.\n","Legitimate|The email originates from a perl.org email address, which is the official domain for the Perl programming language community. It promotes a job posting on jobs.perl.org, a legitimate job board for Perl-related positions. The email provides unsubscribe instructions and contact information, standard practice for legitimate mailing lists. The job description seems plausible for a Perl developer role. The sender address and the link in the email body both align with the perl.org domain. While the body has some formatting issues, that does not definitively make it phishing, it might just mean the email was old or the posting was copied over without proper formatting.\n","Phishing|The email is unsolicited, contains a generic subject, and has a vague and suspicious body promoting \"medication safe and effective\" with a generic call to action. The sender's email address, while appearing legitimate (kp.org), could be spoofed. The combination of these factors suggests a phishing attempt to lure the recipient to a potentially malicious website.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN Daily Top 10 email. The links provided appear to direct to CNN.com. The email provides options to manage email settings and unsubscribe. The sender's domain, although suspicious, is related to dealerspace.com which may be used for mass emails or marketing campaigns, and the email content is consistent with news headlines.\n","Phishing|The email is from an unusual sender address, the subject is vague and enticing, and the body contains generic claims about providing medications, followed by seemingly random words at the end, which is a common tactic used by spammers.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine daily top 10 email from CNN.com. It includes relevant links and URLs related to CNN and its services. The links in the email seem to direct to the actual CNN website. Also, the email includes standard footers seen in legitimate emails, such as copyright information, contact information, and unsubscribe links.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a legitimate CNN.com Daily Top 10 email. The sender's domain, \"zamilsteel.com,\" is unusual, but the links in the body all point to CNN.com, and the email includes standard disclaimers, copyright information, and unsubscribe links that are consistent with legitimate email newsletters.\n","Phishing|Reason: The email promotes prescription drugs without a prescription, offers express delivery and secure checkout via credit card, and has a suspicious sender email address (\"BRalpine@packbell.net\") and website URL (\"www.outgoeffmedical.com\"). These are common tactics used in phishing scams related to pharmaceuticals.\n","Phishing|The email exhibits several red flags characteristic of phishing or spam:\n","\n","1.  Suspicious Sender Address: While the domain `geneontology.org` might be legitimate, the \"RomeoregistrarNoble\" part of the email address looks nonsensical and is often used in spam or phishing emails to impersonate someone.\n","2.  Generic Recipient Address: The recipient address \"ser@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc\" appears to be a catch-all address for a challenge, meaning the sender likely blasted this email to many addresses, a common tactic of spammers and phishers.\n","3.  Subject Line: The subject \"Ravishing Bvlgari watches at Replica Classics\" is typical of spam advertising counterfeit goods.\n","4.  Body Content: The body promotes \"replica watches, pens, bags\" and \"cheap luxury gifts,\" clearly indicating the sale of counterfeit goods.\n","5.  Suspicious Link: The URL `http://minimsoyawl.com/` is likely a shortened or obfuscated link to a website selling counterfeit goods, or worse, a site designed to steal personal information or install malware. The domain name itself appears unrelated to watches or luxury goods.\n","6. Date: The email being from 2008 is another red flag, as it's unlikely to be relevant or legitimate after such a long time.\n","Legitimate|The email appears to be a genuine summary of Python-Dev mailing list activity from April 1-15, 2007. The content discusses technical topics related to Python development, such as SSL tests, subprocess termination, buffer protocols, and various bug fixes and proposals. The email includes detailed information about contributing threads and references specific bug reports and PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals). The sender, Calvin Spealman, may be a community member compiling these summaries. While the sender's email address \"ppcwedbyff@gmail.com\" is slightly unusual, it is not inherently indicative of phishing, and the content itself seems legitimate. The inclusion of a blog link and the standard Python-Dev mailing list footer further support the email's authenticity. There's no call to action requesting personal information or directing the recipient to a suspicious website. Given this context, it is likely a legitimate email from a contributor to the Python community.\n","Phishing|Reason: The sender's email address (akstcallawasayamnsdgs@allawasaya.com) is suspicious and doesn't match the apparent subject of \"Splendid Health Joy.\" The link to a \"spaces.live.com\" blog is also a common tactic used in phishing emails to redirect users to malicious websites. The vague subject line and generic greeting/signature further increase suspicion. The mention of \"Extraordinary Medicinal Options\" also suggests potential spam or a scam.\n","✅ Processed: header_body_sample_75_without_label.csv → Saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/002 SP 25
